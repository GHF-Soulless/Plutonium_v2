   Plutonium v2 is a malware created by The Greyhound Foundation. When ran as administrator on a Windows machine, it will (in order):
delete all contents of the user's C drive (including all registry keys, System32, and the rest of Windows, therefore killing the software),
create a zip bomb on the target desktop, while simultaneously detonating it in order to overload the system's CPU and RAM,
melt the target's screen, and flash numerous colors in a constant loop. 
  By installing Plutonium v2 (like all of our projects), you agree to the following terms:
-You take full responsibility for anything that is caused by your actions involving our software.
-You are unable to blame The Greyhound Foundation, any of it's members, or any relevant entities besides yourself and/or closely involved non-GHF members
for your decisions, or the consequences that accompany them.
-You will not launch this software on a target who is unknowing, or without full authorization.
-You will not launch this software on a device used by anyone who is photosensitive, as the constant loop of flashing lights towards the
end of the process can very easily kill anyone who has a medical condition related to such.
-You know that your actions can and will have many consequences, whether these are positive or negative is up to you.
-You will not break any legal guidelines by commiting acts involving our software.
-Anything that you do with our software is your own fault, and The Greyhound Foundation takes zero responsibility for your actions.
  Plutonium v2 should work as intended on Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines, however due to numerous projects being developed simultaneously
on a very tight schedule, not much testing was done and we unfortunately cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that it is fully functional.
The Greyhound Foundation apologizes greatly for this, and we plan to do more testing once other projects become more developed.
